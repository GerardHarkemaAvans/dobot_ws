# Generic FlexBE States [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FlexBE/generic_flexbe_states.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FlexBE/generic_flexbe_states)

A collection of robot-agnostic FlexBE states for navigation, manipulation,
perception, etc. They are agnostic in the sense that they only depend on
generic ROS packages, such as *MoveIt!*, and generic ROS topics.
